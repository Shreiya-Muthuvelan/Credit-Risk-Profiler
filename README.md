## ⚙️ ML Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Removed non-informative columns based on correlation and domain knowledge  
   - Handled missing values using median imputation  
   - Balanced classes via random undersampling to improve recall for minority class  

2. **Model Development**  
   - Algorithm: XGBoost Classifier for binary classification  
   - Metrics: Precision, Recall, and F1-score to evaluate model robustness  

3. **Deployment**  
   - UI: Streamlit with a clean, banking-inspired theme  
   - Hosting: Streamlit Community Cloud with serialized model using Joblib
