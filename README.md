## 🧠 ML Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values
   - Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
   - Applied **SMOTE** to balance class distribution

2. **Modeling**
   - Built a Neural Network using Keras with Dense layers
   - Used **Softmax** activation, `SparseCategoricalCrossentropy` loss, and `Adam` optimizer
   - Implemented **EarlyStopping** to reduce overfitting

3. **Deployment**
   - Developed an interactive Streamlit UI with a clean banking theme
   - Deployed on **Streamlit Community Cloud** for public access
